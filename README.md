### Degree Overview
Organizations in all industries are collecting vast amounts of data about their customers, operations, and financial performance. However, leaders of these organizations struggle with how to make that data useful so informed decisions can be made. They are seeking people with the right expertise to guide them.

Bellevue University’s online Master of Science in Data Science degree is designed to prepare you to be in the driver’s seat to curate, analyze, and make relevant discoveries from large data sets. You’ll learn the tools, methodologies, and systems needed to solve complex problems in almost any field. No data science or computing experience is required but it would be helpful to have some background in math, computing, and statistics.

The online Data Science graduate program brings together business analytics, visualization, computer science, and statistics to address the entire process of data science. You’ll apply your skills by gathering, preparing, analyzing and presenting data to business leaders and/or clients. While many programs emphasize programming or statistics, ours strikes a balance between the two in order to prepare you for this ever-changing field.
